However, it reduces the feature diversity, which could negatively affect model performance.\n",

    "Hi, I've tried improving the features, an additional thing I did was to calculate the 5, 10 and 30 day averages and then calculated the slope of these and used the slopes as features.  I'm starting to get some right predictions but the precision is still poor.  I had a couple of things to ask you about.  \n",
    "Currently each row of the feature set has infromation about the past from slopes of averages, indicators mentioned above.  I wander if a normal nural network might be a good option rather than a time series RNN? One current problem is that the 'true' events in the labels account for only about 10% of the feature rows.  So the data sets are imbalenced.  I was thinking, because a more standard neural network evaluates one row at a time, maybe I could add synthetic data by duplicating the rows and randomly placing them in the dataset to balance up the number of rows from each class (0 & 1).  If I did this on the RNN model I think it might mess up its memory of the series.  What do you think?\n",

    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "You're making excellent progress by improving your features with slopes and averages—great work! Let me address your questions step by step:\n",
    "1. Should You Use an RNN or a Standard Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a standard neural network depends on how you frame your problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    RNNs:\n",
    "        Best when the sequence or order of the data is critical, and patterns unfold over time. For example, if the target event depends on how the stock behaved over the past days in a time-dependent way, an RNN (or GRU/LSTM) can capture these temporal patterns.\n",
    "        RNNs struggle with imbalanced data, as you mentioned, because they rely on sequences, and duplicating rows randomly might disrupt the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standard Neural Networks (Dense Networks):\n",
    "        If your feature engineering has already captured the historical context (e.g., slopes, averages, indicators), a standard neural network may suffice. Each row of features can represent a snapshot with embedded historical information, making time-dependence less important.\n",
    "        A dense network is easier to train and less prone to memory-related issues compared to an RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced datasets are a common challenge, especially in financial and rare event prediction. Here are some strategies to address the imbalance:\n",
    "Option 1: Synthetic Data Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicating rows or generating synthetic data for the minority class can help balance the dataset, especially for a dense network. For RNNs, duplicating rows disrupts the sequence, so it’s better suited for standard neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead of direct duplication, you could consider SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples based on the feature space:\n",
    "\n",
    "from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "# Separate features and labels\n",
    "X, y = data[feature_columns], data['labels']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply SMOTE to generate synthetic data\n",
    "smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=0.5, random_state=42)  # Adjust strategy to desired balance\n",
    "X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check new class distribution\n",
    "print(y_resampled.value_counts())\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well with dense networks but might disrupt sequences for RNNs.\n",
    "Option 2: Weighted Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "For both RNNs and dense networks, a weighted loss function helps handle imbalance by penalizing misclassification of the minority class more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, you can use class_weight during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute class weights\n",
    "from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight\n",
    "\n",
    "class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y), y=y)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Train the model with class weights\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, class_weight=class_weight_dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3: Focal Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Focal Loss modifies the standard cross-entropy loss to focus more on hard-to-classify examples (useful for rare events). Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n",
    "\n",
    "def focal_loss(alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0):\n",
    "    def loss(y_true, y_pred):\n",
    "        bce = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "        p_t = tf.where(K.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, 1 - y_pred)\n",
    "        focal_loss = alpha * K.pow(1 - p_t, gamma) * bce\n",
    "        return K.mean(focal_loss)\n",
    "    return loss\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compile model with focal loss\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=focal_loss(), metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4: Undersampling Majority Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reduce the number of rows from the majority class to match the minority class. While simple, this can lose valuable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.utils import resample\n",
    "\n",
    "# Separate majority and minority classes\n",
    "majority = data[data['labels'] == 0]\n",
    "minority = data[data['labels'] == 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Downsample majority class\n",
    "majority_downsampled = resample(majority, replace=False, n_samples=len(minority), random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine minority and downsampled majority\n",
    "balanced_data = pd.concat([majority_downsampled, minority])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which Approach to Try?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your current problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If your features capture sufficient historical context (e.g., slopes, averages, RSI), a dense network might perform well.\n",
    "    For dense networks, oversampling minority rows or using SMOTE is a good idea.\n",
    "    If using an RNN, use class weights or focal loss to handle the imbalance instead of duplicating rows.\n",
    "    Evaluate your models using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC since accuracy is misleading for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try training a dense network with SMOTE or class weights and evaluate performance.\n",
    "    Experiment with RNNs using class weights or focal loss to preserve time-series integrity.\n",

    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "No, the scaling values (min and max) used for all four features will not necessarily be the same as those used for just the high feature. Here’s why:\n",
    "How Scaling Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The MinMaxScaler transforms data using the formula:\n",
    "Xscaled=X−XminXmax−Xmin\n",
    "Xscaled​=Xmax​−Xmin​X−Xmin​​\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    XminXmin​ and XmaxXmax​ are calculated from the data used to fit the scaler.\n",
    "    If you fit the scaler to all four features (open, high, low, close), the scaler computes separate min and max values for each column.\n",
    "    If you fit the scaler to just one feature (high), the min and max are computed only from that feature's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scaling All Features (open, high, low, close):\n",
    "        Each feature gets its own min and max based on its respective range in the dataset.\n",
    "        When you use this scaler to transform data, all four features are scaled independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scaling the high Feature Separately:\n",
    "        The scaler considers only the range of the high feature.\n",
    "        This means the scaled values for high using a separate scaler might differ from the scaled high values when using the scaler fitted to all four features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to predict the high feature and then inverse-transform the predictions to the original scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The inverse transform must match the scaling parameters (min and max) used during training.\n",
    "    Using a separate scaler for high ensures consistency between the training and inverse transformation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the data for the features looks like this:\n",
    "Feature\tMin Value\tMax Value\n",
    "open\t100\t200\n",
    "high\t110\t210\n",
    "low\t90\t180\n",
    "close\t105\t195\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you fit the scaler to all four features, it will use the individual min and max for each feature:\n",
    "        open: 100–200\n",
    "        high: 110–210\n",
    "        low: 90–180\n",
    "        close: 105–195\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you fit the scaler only to the high feature, it will use:\n",
    "        high: 110–210\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the scaled values for high would differ between these two approaches.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure accuracy, when predicting high, use a scaler specifically fitted to high during:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Normalize all input features (open, high, low, close):\n",
    "        feature_scaler.fit_transform(features) scales the entire features array using the MinMaxScaler. Each feature column (open, high, low, close) is scaled independently, meaning their respective min and max values are used for normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Normalize the target feature (high) independently:\n",
    "        target_scaler.fit_transform(features[:, 1].reshape(-1, 1)) scales the high column separately using another MinMaxScaler. This ensures that the scaling parameters (min and max) are specific to the high values, which is crucial for later inverse transformation.\n",

    "    Create sequences:\n",

    "\n",
    "Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "    By separating the scaling of the input features and the target feature, you ensure:\n",
    "        The input data is normalized consistently across all features (open, high, low, close).\n",
    "        The target (high) can be inverse-transformed correctly later, as the target_scaler only considers the high values during scaling.\n",
    "\n",

    "Yes, adding indicators to your model can help improve the accuracy of predictions by providing additional context about the stock market's behavior. These indicators are typically derived from the raw data (e.g., moving averages, relative strength index, Bollinger Bands) and capture trends, momentum, or volatility. You can include them as additional feature columns in your input data.\n",

    "2. Check the pip freeze History (If Available)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've been running pip freeze to track your environment's package versions, there may be a history of versions for numpy. Check if you have any previous requirements.txt files or other files where you've logged the installed packages.\n",

    "The error you're seeing suggests that there is a compatibility issue when trying to load the .pkl (pickle) file. This can happen for a few reasons, such as:\n",

    "    Python Version Mismatch: The pickle file might have been saved using a different version of Python or libraries (such as Pandas or NumPy) than you're using now.\n",
    "    Corrupted Pickle File: The pickle file itself could be corrupted.\n",
    "    Incompatibility Between Pandas and Pickle: Sometimes, certain versions of Pandas have problems unpickling files due to changes in how objects are serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can troubleshoot and try to fix it:\n",
    "1. Check Pandas and Python Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure you're using the same version of Pandas and Python that was used to save the pickle file. You can check the versions like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sys\n",

    "If the versions don't match, you might want to use the same versions or upgrade/downgrade your environment accordingly.\n",
    "2. Try Using joblib for Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pickle file was saved using joblib (which is often more robust for saving large data structures like Pandas DataFrames), you could try loading the file with joblib instead of pickle:\n",
    "\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "\n",
    "df = joblib.load(\"Screened_NWG.pkl\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try to Use pickle with encoding=\"latin1\" or bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the issue is related to the encoding used while saving the file. You can try specifying the encoding when loading the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_pickle(\"Screened_NWG.pkl\", encoding='latin1')\n",
    "\n",
    "If the issue persists, try 'bytes' encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_pickle(\"Screened_NWG.pkl\", encoding='bytes')\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check for Specific Classes or Modules Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message indicates that it’s failing while attempting to unpickle some specific object (like a PeriodArray in Pandas). If possible, try to confirm which specific modules or classes were used to create the pickle file and ensure they are available in your current environment.\n",
    "5. Try to Recreate the Pickle File\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have access to the source of the pickle file (e.g., the original script or data), it may be easiest to re-save the data in a more compatible format (e.g., CSV or HDF5):\n",

    "    Ensure you're using compatible versions of Python and Pandas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Potential Solutions\n",
    "1. Check the Version Mismatch (Pandas and NumPy)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible that the file was saved with a different version of Pandas or NumPy. To resolve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Check the versions of Pandas and NumPy you have installed now and compare them to the versions when the file was saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "print(\"Pandas version:\", pd.__version__)\n",
    "print(\"NumPy version:\", np.__version__)\n",
    "\n",
    "If they don't match the versions that created the pickle file, you might want to install the same versions.\n",
    "2. Try to Load with joblib Instead of pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes joblib is more resilient when dealing with certain types of objects in pickle files, especially with large data structures. Try using joblib to load the pickle file:\n",
    "\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "df = joblib.load(\"Screened_NWG.pkl\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Upgrade Pandas and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not using the latest versions of Pandas or NumPy, try upgrading both to their latest versions, as this might help with compatibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pandas numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check for Period or DateTime Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message mentions PeriodArray, which typically comes up when working with time series data. If your pickle file contains time series data using Pandas Period or DatetimeIndex, and you're unable to load it, you might need to ensure you have the appropriate modules installed to handle these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if you are dealing with Period objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.info()\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataframe contains time series with Period types, and you need to recreate the pickle file, you could use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "df['new_date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(df['your_date_column'], format='%Y-%m-%d')\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to convert the Period type to a standard Datetime type and then save it again to avoid issues when loading.\n",
    "5. Manual Steps to Fix Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of the above work and you have control over how the pickle file is created:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try recreating the pickle file in a more compatible format, like CSV, HDF5, or Parquet.\n",
    "    Save the data in a standard format:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.to_csv('new_file.csv', index=False)  # Save as CSV\n",
    "# or\n",
    "df.to_hdf('new_file.h5', key='df', mode='w')  # Save as HDF5\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Try Using pickle with encoding='latin1'\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding may help in some cases when you encounter issues with Python 2.x and Python 3.x incompatibilities in pickle.\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_pickle(\"Screened_NWG.pkl\", encoding='latin1')\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue seems related to a compatibility mismatch with certain data structures (e.g., PeriodArray). Here are the steps you can try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Check the version of Pandas and NumPy you're using and compare them to the version that created the pickle file.\n",
    "    Use joblib for loading if the file was saved with joblib.\n",
    "    Upgrade your Pandas and NumPy versions to the latest.\n",
    "    Check the presence of Period or DateTime types in the file and convert them if necessary.\n",
    "    Recreate the file in a different format (CSV, HDF5, etc.) if possible.\n",

    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, exactly! After training the updated GRU model, you could provide a sequence of 15 days of input data (based on the window size) to the model, and it would predict the next 5 days as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a detailed breakdown of how this works:\n",
    "Process for Predicting 5 Days Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "    Training Phase:\n",
    "        The updated GRU model is trained to map a 15-day sequence of data (X_train) to the next 5 days (y_train).\n",
    "        The model learns the patterns in the input sequence and how they relate to the next 5 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prediction Phase:\n",
    "        After the model is trained, you can use it to predict future values:\n",
    "            Provide the model with a single 15-day sequence (X_test[0] or any sequence from your test data).\n",
    "            The model will output the predicted values for the next 5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example Code: Assuming you’ve trained the model as described:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Provide the last 15 days of data from X_test\n",
    "input_sequence = X_test[-1]  # Shape: (window_size, num_features)\n",
    "input_sequence = input_sequence.reshape(1, input_sequence.shape[0], input_sequence.shape[1])  # Reshape for batch size\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict the next 5 days\n",
    "next_5_days = gru_model.predict(input_sequence)  # Shape: (1, 5)\n",
    "print(\"Predicted next 5 days:\", next_5_days[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: To visualize the predicted results against actual data (if available):\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.plot(range(15), X_test[-1][:, 0], label=\"Input (last 15 days)\")  # Assuming the first feature is the target\n",
    "    plt.plot(range(15, 20), y_test[-1], label=\"Actual next 5 days\")  # Actual values for the next 5 days\n",
    "    plt.plot(range(15, 20), next_5_days[0], label=\"Predicted next 5 days\")  # Predicted values\n",
    "    plt.legend()\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sliding Predictions: If you want to predict even further into the future, you can use the predicted values as input for subsequent predictions. This is called \"recurrent forecasting\":\n",
    "        Predict 5 days → Append the predictions to the input → Use the new sequence to predict the next 5 days, and so on.\n",
    "    Scaling and Inverse Transform:\n",

    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the future predictions need to be scaled back (inverse-transformed) before plotting them alongside the original data. If the predictions appear near zero, it's likely because the model outputs normalized values, which are not comparable to the original scale of the data until they are inverse-transformed.\n",

    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scaling Back the Predictions:\n",
    "        future_predictions_scaled is already inverse-transformed using target_scaler.inverse_transform().\n",
    "        Make sure you are using these scaled-back values for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scaling Back the Original Data:\n",
    "        original_data_scaled is generated by inverse-transforming the original features[:, target_feature_index] if it was normalized during preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aligning Prediction Days:\n",
    "        future_days starts from the index following the last data point in features and continues for the number of future predictions (len(future_predictions_scaled)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This adjustment ensures both the original data and predictions are on the same scale and accurately represented on the graph. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!\n",
    "You said:\n",
    "I got a similar result, However, I hadn't noticed before that the y scale is 1e6, maybe the original is scaled up more than once?\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "If your y-axis is in the range of 106106 (i.e., 1e6), and the future predictions appear near zero, it does suggest that either the original data was scaled or transformed in a way that hasn't been consistently reversed. This could happen if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Double Scaling: The original target feature was scaled or transformed multiple times (e.g., normalization followed by another transformation) but only partially reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Incorrect Feature Selection During Scaling Back: If the wrong feature or transformation parameters are used for scaling back the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mismatch in Scaling Back: The model’s output was scaled back inconsistently with how the original data was preprocessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Debug and Resolve\n",
    "1. Verify the Original Data Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Check how the target feature (high) was preprocessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Was it scaled using MinMaxScaler?\n",
    "    Are you sure the correct column (target feature) was used during scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can confirm this by comparing a sample from the scaled dataset (features_normalized[:, target_feature_index]) with the inverse-transformed version of the same sample (target_scaler.inverse_transform()).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify the inverse transformation matches the original scale\n",
    "scaled_sample = features_normalized[:, target_feature_index][:5]\n",
    "original_sample = df2['high'].values[:5]  # Replace 'high' with your target feature\n",
    "\n",
    "inverse_transformed_sample = target_scaler.inverse_transform(scaled_sample.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()\n",
    "print(\"Original Sample:\", original_sample)\n",
    "print(\"Inverse-Transformed Sample:\", inverse_transformed_sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensure Correct Inverse Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the model's predictions are inverse-transformed using the same scaler that was used to normalize the target feature (high):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inverse transform the model predictions\n",
    "future_predictions_scaled = target_scaler.inverse_transform(np.array(future_predictions).reshape(-1, 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verify Y-axis Scaling on the Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original data appears scaled up, ensure you are plotting the scaled-back version of the target feature alongside the predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Original data should be inverse-transformed if it was scaled\n",
    "original_data_scaled = target_scaler.inverse_transform(features[:, target_feature_index].reshape(-1, 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future predictions are already scaled back\n",
    "plt.plot(original_data_scaled, label=\"Original Data\")\n",
    "plt.plot(future_days, future_predictions_scaled, label=\"Future Predictions\", marker='o', color='red')\n",
    "\n",

    "plt.ylabel(\"Target Feature\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.title(\"Original Data and Future Predictions\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check for Any Additional Scaling or Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "If the high feature was transformed in a way beyond MinMaxScaler (e.g., multiplied by a factor or log-transformed), this must be accounted for during the inverse transformation of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a log transformation was applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "    future_predictions_scaled = np.exp(future_predictions_scaled)\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've confirmed the preprocessing and ensured consistent scaling back, the predictions and original data should align correctly on the y-scale of the graph. If the issue persists, share additional details of how the original dataset was processed, and I'll help you troubleshoot further!\n",
    "You said:\n",
    "when I used the code in step 1 above the numbers for both original and inverse-transformed look fine\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "If the numbers for both the original and inverse-transformed data look fine in Step 1, then the preprocessing and scaling for the target feature are likely correct. The issue might lie elsewhere, such as in how the data is being plotted or how the predictions are being updated during the iterative future predictions process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s methodically check and address the possibilities:\n",
    "Key Checks & Resolutions\n",
    "1. Check the Plotting Step\n",

    "# Check raw predictions before scaling back\n",

    "\n",
    "If these values are disproportionately low (near zero), the issue could stem from:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model training (e.g., insufficient epochs or ineffective learning).\n",
    "    Mismatch in the model’s understanding of scaled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Validate Input Updates During Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the input_sequence is being updated correctly during the iterative prediction process. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Confirm that the new day's prediction is appended correctly.\n",
    "    Ensure that the dimensions of the updated input_sequence are consistent with the model’s expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double-check the key part of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "for _ in range(5):  # Predict 5 days ahead\n",
    "    # Predict next value\n",

    "    input_sequence = new_day.reshape((1, new_day.shape[0], new_day.shape[1]))\n",
    "\n",
    "If the predictions are still significantly low:\n",

    "print(f\"Step {_ + 1}, Input Sequence (last day):\", input_sequence[0, -1])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inspect Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything else checks out but the predictions remain near zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Check Training Data Distribution: Ensure that the target feature isn’t highly imbalanced or dominated by near-zero values in the training set.\n",
    "    Evaluate Model Performance: Plot the loss and accuracy metrics during training to see if the model has converged properly.\n",
    "    Adjust Model Parameters: Consider:\n",
    "        Increasing GRU units.\n",
